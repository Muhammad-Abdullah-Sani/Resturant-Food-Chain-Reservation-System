# Restaurant (Food Chain) Reservation System

## Introduction

The Restaurant (Food Chain) Reservation System allows customers to make table reservations at any branch of a restaurant chain through a web-based service. Customers can easily register and check the availability of tables to book their reservations online.  

Restaurant managers can approve or reject bookings, manage table details, and review customer feedback. The admin has full control over branches, users, and reservation records.  

This system reduces manual booking errors, minimizes double bookings, and provides customers the convenience of making reservations from anywhere at any time.
