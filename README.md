# Resturant-Food-Chain-Reservation-System
Restaurant (Food Chain) Reservation System allows one to make table  
reservations in any of the branches of a particular restaurant chain  
through a web-based service. The customers can easily register and  
browse the availability of tables accordingly to book their tables online.  
The managers of the restaurants can either approve or reject bookings,  
manage details of tables, and review customer feedback. The admin will  
have full control over the branches, users, and records of reservations.  
The system will reduce manual booking mistakes, minimize double  
bookings, and provide customers with more convenience in making  
reservations from anywhere and at any time.
